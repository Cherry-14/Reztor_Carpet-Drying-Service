ATTENTION CALL THE EXPERTS NOW     1800-739-867 We know it can be tough to decide what to do when your carpet is wet or flooded. Don’t be fooled by the misinformation provided by insurance companies, flooring companies or DIY “experts.” During this stressful time, make sure you know the facts so you can make the right decision for your situation. If you’re dealing with a wet carpet, the first thing you should do is call a water restoration company and here’s why: MYTH #1 This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: MYTH #2 This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: I need to call my insurance provider before I act You shouldn’t wait - you need to act now! When it comes to water damage it’s crucial to call a water restoration company as quickly as possible, ideally within the first 24 hours of water exposure. The longer you wait, the more problems you’re going to have in your home. It’s important to have a water restoration company handle the situation before you call your insurance, otherwise you’ll waste precious time needed to save your property from additional water and microbial damage. Insurance companies will also try to convince you to work with one of their “approved” partners. We’ll talk more about why that’s a bad move in the next myth. Water quickly spreads from the carpet into any underlayment you may have and even into your subfloor! Water can also get behind your baseboards and into even the tiniest crevices in your walls (like small cracks in the caulk). If water gets into your subfloor or walls, you’ll likely have structural damage in the future. Plus, wet carpets often cause mould, mildew and bacteria to grow. In fact, in Queensland, mould starts to grow within 2-3 days of water exposure!  My insurance provider will send a trusted company that will provide top-notch service, completely fix my wet carpet problem, and prevent future problems like structural damage and mould.  Many insurance providers will set you up with an “approved” company that they have a partnership with. These approved partners get a large amount of work from the insurance providers and unfortunately worry more about whether the insurance company is happy rather than if you’re happy. By working with one of your insurance company’s approved partners, you may end up with a company that only does the bare minimum because their ultimate goal is to protect the insurance company’s money- not to protect you! You can read more about that here.   When you hire the right water restoration team, you can be confident that your health and property are their #1 concern. With Reztor Restoration, you’ll get everything you need for insurance purposes provided to you in a professional document created by one of our expert technicians. MYTH #3  This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: My carpet will dry by itself - I just need a fan or two and an open window.  This misinformation may lead you to believe your problem will solve itself and that you don’t need to take immediate action to dry your carpet. The truth is, your carpet won’t dry overnight - or ever, without the proper care! It takes more than a few fans and a wet vac to prevent water damage to your home. If you don’t take your wet carpet seriously, you might face serious health and structural problems in the future due to ongoing water damage and microbial growth. MYTH #4  This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: I’ll save a ton of money by fixing the problem myself  Just one mistake can cause hundreds to thousands of dollars worth of future damage. Without thermal imaging, professional-grade moisture detection, or certified expertise, it’s almost impossible to guarantee the problem is completely fixed. Even if you manage to get your carpet dry to the touch, there’s most likely still moisture trapped under the carpet, in the subfloors, or behind your baseboards/trim.   In just a couple of days mould, mildew and bacteria will start to grow in the moisture, leading to massive property damage and life-threatening conditions. DIY carpet drying is dangerous if you don’t know what you’re doing. The water could be contaminated and therefore a serious health concern. For example, flood-water should always be left to the experts as it often contains toxic mould spores and bacteria. MYTH #5   This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: Carpet Cleaning Companies have machines that can properly dry my carpet, underlayment and subfloor While many carpet cleaning companies will use industrial water extractors to clean carpets, proper water damage restoration is much more complex and requires top-notch technology paired with industry-leading expertise. Carpet cleaning machines and wet-vacs will not completely solve your problem.  MYTH #6 This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: Carpet cleaning companies are professional water damage restoration teams Only IICRC certified water restoration specialty companies can truly help with wet carpet damage. Avoid water damage rip-offs and go with the pros! MYTH #7  This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: Replacing my carpet with new carpet will fix the issue  Even though replacing your carpet will get rid of the old wet carpet, you need to completely remove all water, moisture, and microbial growth to ensure your property is safe. Simply replacing the carpet is not enough!  Water can (and will!) get into:  With enough time water will damage everything in its path. Although in some situations it is best to completely replace wet carpet, that’s never the only thing that needs to be done. If you’re thinking about ripping up your carpet and installing new carpet (or paying someone to do it for you), you still need to call a water restoration company to find and eliminate all moisture, dry any affected structures, and prevent deadly mould from growing. MYTH #8 This myth is - FALSE Here’s the truth: If my carpet gets wet, it NEEDS to be replaced  In most cases, we can save your carpet (and save you tons of money)! With our state-of-the-art equipment and expertly trained technicians, Reztor Restoration can almost always dry your carpet without the need for invasive/disruptive works within your home.  We take all variables into consideration when deciding whether your carpet can be saved, including:  How long the carpet has been wet. Remember that even if the carpet needs to be replaced, the property’s subfloor and structure will need to be dried before any new flooring can be installed. If the new carpet is laid on a wet subfloor, you could be in the same boat as when you started because trapped humidity underneath the new carpet can lead to microbial growth or other secondary damage. Whether the water came from a clean or contaminated source. If the carpet’s backing is still in good condition, or if it de-laminated you with the necessary documentation for your insurance claim. If the water has caused permanent staining in the carpet. If there is any microbial growth present 1 2 3 4 5 We send highly-trained, expert technicians who will treat you like family (after all, compassion is one of our company values)   A Wet Carpet Is About More Than Just The Water You Can See - You  Need A Professional Water Restoration Company To Make Sure The Problem Is Solved Right The First Time...
